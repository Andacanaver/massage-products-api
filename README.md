<h1>Massage Therapy Products API</h1>

<p>This project is the back end for a full stack application that I created in hopes of one day using for a e-commerce website. It holds the services and routing for finding the products in the database as well as users, which include usernames, passwords and emails.</p>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>Node.js</li>
  <li>Express</li>
  <li>Postgresql</li>
</ul>

<h2>Launch</h2>

<ol>
  <li>clone the repo</li>
  <li>'npm install' in the directory</li>
  <li>create the database and run 'npm run migrate' in the database</li>
  <li>'npm start' or 'npm run dev' to start the server</li>
</ol>

<h2>Functionality</h2>
<p>This server is used mainly for POST and GET requests by the client. In the future I would like to get the PATCH and DELETE requests up and running.</p>

<h2>Project Status</h2>
<p>This project is at a Minimal Viable Product (MVP).</p>
